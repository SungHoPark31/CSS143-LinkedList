# CSS143-LinkedList
In this assignment, we’ll build three classes that will
implement a List, a Stack, and a Queue using Nodes and 
references rather than arrays. 

The Stack and Queue will inherit from the List (a linked list)
class, and so these subclasses will be rather short.  Then, 
build a simple LinkedListException class that will be thrown 
in place of RuntimeExceptions whenever exceptional or error 
situations occur.

Note:  Throughout this document, we will usually refer to the
List implementation using Nodes and references (i.e., as a linked
list) as “List”.  However, you should not confuse this with the 
Java built-in interface List, which has the same name.  At this 
point, it won’t be an issue; it’s just something to keep in mind 
in the future.
